# Silkworm Classification
 
With its inherent luster, silk is the most prestigious fabric in the world and is referred to as the "Queen of Textiles" in popular culture. The result of sericulture is silk. Multidisciplinary in nature, sericulture is a labor-intensive, rural enterprise. There are agriculture operations involved. Like growing mulberries, raising silkworms, producing eggs, making cocoons, and presented are off-farm activities such raw silk reeling, spinning, throwing, and weaving. Figure 1 shows how grain storage facilities create silkworm eggs that farmers can use for raising silkworms. The mulberry leaves are used to feed the hatching eggs or larvae. Here is the stage of development when most growth occurs. During its pupal stage, the silkworm weaves a known as a cocoon, a protective covering. The cocoons are crucial for business. Those are reeled for the best material, "silk." To advance the silkworm's genetic line, The grain age centers are given access to the cocoons in order to increase silk production. Separating the male and female cocoons is a crucial operation at the grain age centers’ partnering in order to lay eggs or develop seeds. The silk industry's ability to succeed depends on the quality of the seeds or eggs that are made available to farmers. Egg production for silkworms is an extremely difficult task that calls for meticulous planning and accuracy. The duty is finished with the use of qualified professionals. Figure 2 shows us the benefits of high quality of egg laying as a result of pairing of best male and female cocoons in the 2nd case whereas in the 1st case we could see the reduced quality of the egg laying.
